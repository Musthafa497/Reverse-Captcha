# 🤖 **Reverse Captcha - Prove You're a Robot!**

Welcome to **Reverse Captcha**, the web app where you have to prove you're a robot! Instead of verifying humanity, this app is all about showcasing your "robotic" abilities by completing tasks that only a machine could handle (or so we think!). Built with React and styled with a sleek, sci-fi aesthetic, this project flips the typical CAPTCHA on its head.

## 🎯 **Project Overview**
In this project, the user takes on the challenge of proving they’re a bot by completing specially designed tasks. Using React for the UI, this app features:
- **Binary Conversion Task** 🧑‍💻: A basic binary question that requires the user to convert numbers.
- **Pattern Matching Tasks** ⛓️: Tests for robotic accuracy in pattern replication.
- **Timed Challenges** ⏳: Only a robot could keep up with these lightning-fast response times!

## ✨ **Features**
- **Dark Mode & Neon Styling** 🌌: Styled with a tech-inspired dark theme and neon colors for that futuristic vibe.
- **Task-Specific Feedback** 🎉: Provides immediate feedback on task success or failure.
- **Responsive Design** 📱: Works across devices, so you can prove your robotic nature on desktop or mobile.

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: React, CSS3, HTML5
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with Google Fonts (`Orbitron`) for a tech-inspired look
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for collaborative development
